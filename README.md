# Asteroids
Infinite version of popular arcade game, created in python.

This project mimics the gameplay of popular arcade game Asteroids without the seperate levels features implemented into the original game. I instead have chosen to create an infinite loop, with more asteroids spawning as time progresses. Players can compete for the highest score within the limit of three lives. This project was created in python using the module pygame.
